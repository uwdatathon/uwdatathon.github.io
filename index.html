					All Foods has been a staple for many when it comes to groceries. However, recent changes to operating hours have resulted in a loss of $50,000 in revenue as well as $40,000 in profit. Our team has created multiple data visualization dashboards for our client to understand their products and market at a glance.

				<h2>US Borders</h2>

				<p>

					The store should refrain from selling items that cost more than their selling price, as they result in negative profits. The client can use the below visualization to filter by item and analyze peak seasons at a glance.

					<br><br>

					Avocados exemplify this trend â€” there was a significant positive total profit when the store was growing the avocados themselves, but they were forced to sell at a loss when the cost of acquiring avocados went up. To prevent loss, the store should maximize products that can be acquired or produced at low costs, and either 1. decrease their stock or 2. increase the price of these items during seasons when they cost extra to acquire and are not in demand. Increasing the price of items is a viable option when the demand does not decrease significantly in periods of negative profit.

				<h2>Port Comparisons</h2>

				<p>

					Items with a negative average unit price margin that do not sell well should be removed from the store. However, the store can increase the price of items with high quantities sold that have a negative unit price margin, as the demand is high enough to warrant this change.

					<br><br>

					To determine these items, the client can use the visualization visualization for the average unit price margin and the sum of the quality sold, and filter by negative unit price margin.

				<h2>Seasonal Map</h2>

				<p>

					Basket marketing is a tactical maneuver the store can employ to increase the number of impulse purchases a customer makes. Through this data visualization, by filtering for type of product, the client can determine items that are often bought with it. Placing items that are often bought together in the same section of the store will increase sales, as customers may be more inclined to purchase them.
